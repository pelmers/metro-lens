/**
 * Starting plan: show a map and a way to draw polygons
 * once a polygon is drawn let's show the following statistics:
 * area, perimeter
 * area of parks/green space
 * length + area of roads/highways (issue: osm does not have a width for roads, but sometimes a lane count)
 * area of parking spaces
 * area of buildings
 * area of water
 * area of tree cover
 * number of bus stops
 * number of rail stops
 * length of total bike paths
 * estimated population, population density
 * each of those can be layers that toggle and highlight on the map
